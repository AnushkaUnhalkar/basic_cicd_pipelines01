# ML Testing Pipeline

This project demonstrates a testing strategy for a Machine Learning CI pipeline.

## Types of Tests
- Data validation tests
- Model initialization tests
- Performance threshold tests

## Test Execution
Tests run automatically during Continuous Integration.

## Pipeline Impact
If any test fails, the CI pipeline stops and deployment is blocked.
